		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			Hi, I'm Satwik! I'm a Software Developer based in Boston, Massachusetts, with over one year of
			internship experience in full-stack development, focusing on the back end. I'm currently a
			senior at Northeastern, majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial
			Intelligence. I am very interested in the financial realm, especially in using software to
			make financial education more accessible. Working on this website and tinkering with Svelte
			was a lot of fun, and I'm always open to new technologies and challenges.

			<br />
			<br />

			When I'm not coding, I have a bunch of other interests that keep me busy. I love sports and
			played baseball throughout most of my childhood. As a true Bostonian, I'm a big fan of the
			Patriots, Sox, and Celtics. Traveling is also something I'm very enthusiastic about. I wasn't
			born in the states and moved around a lot as a kid, but I don't remember many of the places I
			went to. I plan to eventually visit all 7 continents (including Antarctica!). Language
			learning is another hobby I've picked up, and I'm currently learning French and improving my
			Hindi. Making and listening to music (particularly hip-hop/rnb) has always been a big part of
			my life as well. If any of these things interest you as well, let's connect üòÅ

			Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat!
